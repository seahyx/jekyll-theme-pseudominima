## Me

I **take pride** in the code I write.

I try to write **legible** code for the stranger in the future, so he or she may at least be able to decode what I wrote.

I try to write code like it's *totally* going be used by a **million** people.

I find it my duty to *not* sacrifice shorter code for more **meaningful** code.

I seek to write comments that are ever so **concise** but **purposeful**.

Or, if you are not a coder, basically what I said is,
> I make sure my code don't end up in a god-forsaken spaghetti mess 1 month down the road.

## This Website

This is the 3rd iteration of [seahyx.github.io](https://seahyx.github.io/).

This website is run using the awesome [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

The theme is modified upon the minimalistically minimalistic [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.

More crucially, I have added **dark mode** which is indispensable and in my opinion, absolutely necessary for everything.
